this feels exciting. 
i hope i can finish it well and properly.
i hope i don't sacrifice things that shouldn't be sacrificed.
i hope i do this well enough to pass.

i did not expect that I'll take forever to eat the tutorials ðŸ˜­. thing is, i feel bleurgh already. like i really don't wanna continue this rn. but i wanna lulus. imma face it again.

ok so, to use the repo by elephant robotics, 
we'll need to understand how to build a workspace in ROS2, which is still quite far from what i ate. oh we got a loooooong way to go.

it's been 2 months now, and im back to learning ROS2. skrg udh sampe tutorial yg "implementing custom interfaces". klo bisa selesain beginner hariini kyknya bagus. klo bisa sampe advanced, lebih bagus lagi. serius seneng bgt akhirnya bisa lanjut balik ke sini T-T. pingin lulus semester ini.

this feels exciting. 
i hope i can finish it well and properly.
i hope i don't sacrifice things that shouldn't be sacrificed.
i hope i do this well enough to pass.

i did not expect that I'll take forever to eat the tutorials ðŸ˜­. thing is, i feel bleurgh already. like i really don't wanna continue this rn. but i wanna lulus. imma face it again.

ok so, to use the repo by elephant robotics, 
we'll need to understand how to build a workspace in ROS2, which is still quite far from what i ate. oh we got a loooooong way to go.

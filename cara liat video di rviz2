Next Steps to See the Video Feed:

To actually see the video feed being published, you need to use another ROS 2 tool that can subscribe to the /camera/image topic and display the image data. A common tool for this is RViz2 with the Image display type.

Here's how you can try to view the feed in RViz2:

Open a new terminal.
Source your ROS 2 environment:
Bash

source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash  # Replace 'galactic' with your ROS 2 distribution if different
source /home/axiomjo/elephantrobotics_ws/install/setup.bash
Launch RViz2:
Bash

ros2 run rviz2 rviz2
In RViz2:
Click the "Add" button (usually in the bottom left panel).
In the "Create New Display" window, find and select "Image".
Click "OK".
In the "Displays" panel, you should now see an "Image" entry. Expand it.
Look for the "Image Topic" property. Click on the dropdown menu next to it and select /camera/image.
If everything is working correctly, you should now see the video feed from your camera displayed in the RViz2 window.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Problem Clearly
Ask: What does this node need to do, and why?

Write: A one-sentence purpose for the node.

Example: ‚ÄúThis node reads a camera feed and publishes RGB images for other nodes.‚Äù

2Ô∏è‚É£ Decide the Node‚Äôs Boundaries
Ask: What‚Äôs inside vs. outside this node?

Avoid: Making a ‚ÄúGod node‚Äù that does everything.

Tip: One node = one main responsibility.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Choose Communication Needs
Ask: Will the node:

Publish data? (Publisher)

Receive data? (Subscriber)

Respond to requests? (Service)

Perform long-running tasks? (Action)

Plan: Define topics/services/actions before coding.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Select Interfaces (msg/srv/action types)
Ask: Can I use a standard ROS 2 message type, or do I need a custom one?

Tip:

Use sensor_msgs, geometry_msgs, etc., if they fit.

Create an interfaces package for custom .msg files if needed.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Plan Configurability
Ask: What should be adjustable without editing code?

Do: Use ROS 2 parameters (YAML configs) for things like speed limits, topic names, thresholds.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Think About Dependencies
Ask: What libraries or packages will this node need?

Tip: Keep dependencies minimal and avoid bringing in heavy packages unless necessary.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Decide Where the Node Lives
Ask: Is this node reusable in other projects?

Yes ‚Üí Put it in its own package.

No, tied to specific hardware ‚Üí Group it with related nodes.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Prototype Small First
Start with a barebones node that logs messages.

Add publishers/subscribers/services one at a time.

Test with ros2 topic echo, ros2 service call, etc.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Write a Launch File Early
Even for one node, make a .launch.py file so you can pass parameters and start it consistently.

üîü Document
Update your README with:

Node purpose

Inputs/outputs

Parameters

Example launch command

If you follow these steps in order, you‚Äôll always have a clear mental model before touching code, which is the #1 way to avoid ROS 2 spaghetti projects.

jadi ya, kan aslinya tahun lalu aku UDAH PERNAH NYOBA VACUUM PUMP nya,  
tapi pake python script doang  
dan sekarang pas aku mo coba lagi  
aku towuuuuuakut  

coz aku aslinya gapaham how it works  
dan pas mvp 1 akhirnya selesai,  
aku towuuuuuakut ngerusak programku  
padahal ya tinggal ganti branch, trus nge-sandbox di sana kan?  

trus ini SIC batch 7  
DAMN THAT PROGRAM LOOKS SO SHINY AND ALLURING  
and i have no confidence to join in and ajak org2.  
and i know myself, i prolly can't handle it yet.  

and so, hariini aku suuuuuuweneng coz akhirnya "bisa nyaman gerakin robotnya ke koordinat yg aku mau"  
i know what to expect.  
it's as expected.  

BUT NOW, I CANT EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW TO ADD THE OTHER FEATURES.  
bro, can i even thrive in this field???
im afraid im gonna wilt.  

honestly, i have more confidence in handcrafts than electronics. and it bugs me.  
maybe because i got to experiment extensively with handcrafts?  
like, my Nai-Nai provided plenty resources so i know its not a scarce resource.  
with elevtronics.... i'm too afraid to break it.  
it sucks.  

btw, i'm tired :'C
and gaji astep blom cair. it sucks.
tapi ya... cukup masian.  

i can go to campus and go home.
i can eat.
i can use electricity and wifi di kampus.

like, i think i should freelance? or join free competitions? do i actually have a chance??? i dunno.  
developing online classes would be a fun. 
but like, i havent even started SOME4 vid :c  
will i miss it again this year? gpp sih, ga mati juga klopun iya.

kinda glad because i can crochet now, and keamren habis bikin crochet bunga :D !
i know how to make it. i have the intuition for it. it's familiar.  
i hope coding and electronics is familiar, but it's not tbh.  
and it's ok, i accept my current self.  

  maybe if one day i got to explore on my own, i will be able to make cool things. maybe.  
  there's this cool resource from https://github.com/microsoft/IoT-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-getting-started  abt IoT, and once, my IT friend gave me a link to a cool arduino book.  
  i just haven't tasted them tbh.   

  kadang aku harap aku klo makan ilmu tuh cepet. taoi jujur engga. aku butuh(?) setahun buat actually nangkep.  
  kyk sisdig di kampus, itu baru ngeh beberapa semester kemudian.  
  trus, git n dkk, baru ngeh setelah dkenalin sm temenku tahun lalu. (tbh, ada resources yg bagus2 juga sih, jadinya lebih familier).
  huh, myb  i just need to try out different things, with a good source. i think that'll be so cool.   

  i kinda expect hand-me-downs from my tutors. i dunno if that can work in kuliah. :\  
  tapi ya aku ga mati meskipun gangerti? ya gaapa juga sih?  

  aku nyadar aku memang terbatas. aslinya bisa dikembangin, tapi aku blom mau bayar effortnya i guess. makanya masih stagnan.  

  yaudah, lets finish this TA. i dont think i can finish it if im not asking for help tbh. kapan konsul?
  mingdep, senen? ini aku nunda konsul udh sampe sebulan astaga.
